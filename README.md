## Directory structure

### SOUNDS

This folder has the audio files already processed and separated by language.

To use them, the language folder (for example, `en`) must be under the `SOUNDS` folder of your `SDCARD`. With the folder added, go to the EdgeTX settings menu and select the language of the audio language that will be used (eg English).

To use any audio on your switches, first copy the file you want to use to your language folder, then you can use this file in your `Global Functions` or `Special Functions` by selecting a switch for the function and choosing the `Play track` option.

## Voices

All of the voices used in the EdgeTX voice packs have been picked from the [neural voices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=speechtotext#prebuilt-neural-voices) offered by Microsft Azure text to speech service, in order to get as close as possible to humanlike voices. If you want to see what voices are available, and try different phrases, [check out the online demo generator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#features). Using some recording software, you could even save your own phrases and use them in the voice packs.

## How to build yourself

In order to generate the voice packages and do the release processing, you will need a Linux environment to run in.
Ubuntu 18.04 is recommended as it is a LTS release. Newer versions and other flavours of Linux will most likely work also, but are not supported.

You will also need to have `ffmpeg`, `spx` and `ffmpeg-normalize` packages installed.

`ffmpeg` is used to clip any silence from the audio files. `ffmpeg-normalise` is used to normalise the audio files.
`spx` is the tool that generates the audio files using Microsoft Azure Text to Speech processing.

Installing SPX can be a little tricky, but can be installed as follows:

```bash
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt-get update; \
  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https && \
  sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-3.1

dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI
```

After you have installed SPX, you will also need to [create a Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/) if you don't have one already. There are both free and paid options, but the free one is sufficient for this purpose - it is just rate limited. After you have done that, [follow the quick start guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/spx-basics) to configure the required region and subscription keys.

## Windows
- download the repo.
    https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx-sdcard-sounds/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
- unzip the folder
- open the folder in windows explorer
- in the folder shift + right click: open powershell here. [if no option then you may have to install powershell]
- install microsoft cognitive services speach
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/spx-basics?tabs=windowsinstall%2Cpowershell
    ```dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI```
    ```dotnet tool update --global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI```
- sign up to azure: credit card required for verification: https://portal.azure.com
- create a speech resource on azure: use free tier
    - choose the following options on setup pages:
    - network: allow all, including internet
    - identity: status:off, leave user assignged managed identies blank
    - tags: leave blank
    -review and create
    -create
    -click 'go to resource'
    -'manage keys'
    - note down your key and endpoint.
- in powershell run these commands and subsitiute subscription key [for your key] and region [your azure region]
    ``` spx --% config @key
        spx --% config @region ```
        ```
        New-Item -Path Env:\COGNITIVE_SERVICE_API_KEY -Value 'YOUR KEY'
        New-Item -Path Env:\SERVICE_REGION -Value 'YOUR REGION
        ```
- install python on your system
    - to check if python is installed:
    
    ```py --version``` 
    -python can be installed from here.
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/
-install python package
    -```pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech```
- run the app
    - the help file ```python ./voice-gen.py --help```
    - ```python ./voice-gen.py ./voices/en-GB.csv libby ./test```
    
    
    


## Alternatives
- Mike has created a python script that can be used to generate the audio using Googles Text to Speech service - https://github.com/xsnoopy/edgetx-sdcard-sounds
- The OpenTX Speaker voice generator (Windows only) uses the built in text to speech engine of Microsoft Windows, andcan be used to generate new audio also. https://www.open-tx.org/2014/03/15/opentx-speaker
